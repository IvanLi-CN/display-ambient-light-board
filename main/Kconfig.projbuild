    config LED_COLOR_ORDER_STRING
        string "LED Color Channel Order"
        default "GRBW"
        help
            Specify the color channel order for your LED strip using letters R, G, B, W.

            Common configurations:
            - WS2812B (RGB): "GRB" or "RGB"
            - SK6812 (RGBW): "GRBW" or "RGBW"

            Examples:
            - "RGB" = Red, Green, Blue (3 channels)
            - "GRB" = Green, Red, Blue (3 channels, most WS2812B)
            - "RGBW" = Red, Green, Blue, White (4 channels)
            - "GRBW" = Green, Red, Blue, White (4 channels, most SK6812)
            - "WRGB" = White, Red, Green, Blue (4 channels, some variants)

            How to determine your LED strip order:
            1. Check your LED strip datasheet or manufacturer specifications
            2. Test with a simple color: set RGB(255,0,0) and see which color appears
            3. If red appears as expected, your strip likely uses RGB order
            4. If green appears instead, your strip likely uses GRB order
            5. For RGBW strips, test white channel separately

            Note: If using mixed LED strips, use RGB order for better compatibility.
            The string length determines the number of channels per LED automatically.



    config UDP_PORT
        int "UDP Server Port"
        default 23042
        range 1024 65535
        help

    config ENABLE_BREATHING_EFFECT
        bool "Enable breathing effect for all LEDs"
        default y
        help
            Enable breathing effect for all LEDs with status indicator on first LED.

    config BREATHING_BASE_COLOR_HEX
        string "Base breathing color (Hex)"
        default "143250"
        depends on ENABLE_BREATHING_EFFECT
        help
            Base breathing color for all LEDs except status LED in hexadecimal format.
            This value is converted to individual color components at compile time.

            Format depends on your LED strip configuration:
            - RGB strips (3 channels): "RRGGBB" (6 characters)
              Example: "FF0000" = Red, "00FF00" = Green, "0000FF" = Blue
            - RGBW strips (4 channels): "RRGGBBWW" (8 characters)
              Example: "FF000000" = Red, "00FF0000" = Green, "0000FF00" = Blue, "000000FF" = White

            The system will automatically validate that the hex string length matches
            your LED_COLOR_ORDER_STRING configuration at compile time.

            Default "143250" = RGB(20,50,80) - a soft blue color.

            Examples:
            - Pure red: "FF0000" (RGB) or "FF000000" (RGBW)
            - Pure white: "FFFFFF" (RGB) or "000000FF" (RGBW, using W channel)
            - Warm white: "FFE4B5" (RGB) or "FFE4B500" (RGBW)
            - Cool blue: "4169E1" (RGB) or "4169E100" (RGBW)

            Note: Color parsing happens at compile time for optimal performance.
